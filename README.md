##Introduction

This project is a team effort by [Sarah Rose Battles](https://github.com/srosebattles),[Logan Hussung](https://github.com/LoganHussung),[Danny Locke](https://github.com/DannyLocke), [Gilbert Akpan](https://github.com/gilbertojnr), and [Ryan Kielty](https://github.com/ryankielty). It is a site for a fictional regional branch of Tesla which offers Tesla cars for purchase to consumers. This is an educational project that is not created or endorsed by Tesla and does not offer real Teslas for sale.

Within the project, one is able to view the different models Tesla offers, as well as chargers. These products can be added to a cart and subsequently "ordered".
