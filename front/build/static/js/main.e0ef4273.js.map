With instant torque, incredible power, and zero emissions, Tesla’s products would be cars without compromise. Each new generation would be increasingly affordable, helping the company work towards its mission: to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport.</p>\n\n            <p>Tesla’s engineers first designed a powertrain for a sports car built around an AC induction motor, patented in 1888 by Nikola Tesla, the inventor who inspired the company’s name. The resulting Tesla Roadster was launched in 2008. Accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds and achieving a range of 245 miles per charge of its lithium ion battery, the Roadster set a new standard for electric mobility. Tesla would sell more than 2,400 Roadsters, now on the road in more than 30 countries. </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/HomePage.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport logo from './Images/teslaname.jpg';\nimport logo2 from './Images/teslalogo.png';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router';\nimport './index.css';\n\n\nexport default class LandingPage extends Component {\n      render() {\n        return (\n          <div className=\"container\">\n            <div className=\"landing\">\n              {/* <img className=\"teslaname\" role=\"presentation\" src={logo} /> */}\n              <h1 className=\"tesla\"> Tesla </h1>\n              <img className=\"teslalogo\" role=\"presentation\" src={logo2} />\n              <h1> Minneapolis </h1>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"homelinkcontainer\">\n              <Link className=\"homelink\" to={\"/home\"}> The Future is Here </Link>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/LandingPage.js","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass NoMatch extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n        <h1>Sorry, we are unable to find the page you requested.
